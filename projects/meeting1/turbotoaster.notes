# This activity will be on paper or on
# the whiteboard. It will not require
# any digital devices.

Description:
    You and several other designers have 
    been employed by Wacky Toaster Co. 
    to create the ultimate toaster. 
    Only one problem, the position said
    "Entry Level - SDE-T", and no one 
    explained that SDE-T stood for 
    "Specialest in Wacky Edibles - Toast"

The Job:
    Form a group of 2-4 people and get
    a piece of paper. Your group is 
    responsible for designing every 
    piece of this toaster from a high
    -level perspective. 

Requirements:
    1) The toaster should have at basic
    kitchen countertop functionality,
    including the ability to toast two
    items at once for a certain amount
    of time.

    2) The toaster needs a cool name.
    Everything in tech has a cool name.
    Research buzzwords if you need to.

    3) Your manager at TurboToaster
    has given you creative liberty to
    decide what makes this toaster
    so wacky. Go wild!

Expected Output:
    # At least 1 Sketch of the toaster,
    # if you need more than one to really
    # show it off, feel free üçû

    # A class diagram of the different
    # objects that make this toaster 
    # run in software. Assume some poor
    # "Entry Level - SDE-I" (implementer)
    # will have to make sense of this
    # later.

    # Present your toaster to everyone!
    # At the end, we'll vote on the true
    # "TurboToaster" which may appear 
    # again in future meetings üòâ
